  name = "test"
}

resource "rabbitmq_permissions" "guest" {
  user  = "guest"
  vhost = "${rabbitmq_vhost.test.name}"

  permissions {
    configure = ".*"
    write     = ".*"
    read      = ".*"
  }
}

resource "rabbitmq_operator_policy" "test" {
  name  = "test"
  vhost = "${rabbitmq_permissions.guest.vhost}"

  policy {
    pattern  = ".*"
    priority = 0
    apply_to = "queues"

    definition = {
      message-ttl = 3600000
      expires = 1800000
    }
